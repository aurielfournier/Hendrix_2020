üìñüê¶ Lessons for R workshop at Hendrix College, AR

Welcome! This is our github page, that will house all the documents for the R workshop at Hendrix College.

There's a couple of things you need to do before we can begin.   
1. Download R and R studio (these are separate things!). Heres a link to help you if you need: https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html

2. Download this repository! At the top of the main page you'll see a button that says 'clone or download'. Please hit 'download.zip' and remember where you put it. If you already are familiar with github than feel free to clone the repository.

For the majority of these lessons we will be using the Data Carpentry R workshop lessons. You can follow along with the lessons if youd like online via the links below. There's also barebones R sheets for each lesson that will help you follow along and write the code as we go.
