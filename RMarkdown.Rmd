## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

a_states <- c("AK","AZ","AR","AL")

mebird <- ebird %>%
     mutate(a_state = ifelse(state %in% a_states, 1, 0),
                   state_year = paste0(state,"_",year),
                   river = "Pascagoula")


head(mebird)

ggplot(data=mebird, 
       aes(x=year, y=presence))+
  geom_point()
```
